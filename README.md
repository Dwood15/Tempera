Tempera is: A mishmash of code from Kornman00 an TheFieryScythe's Open Sauce project, as well as SilentK and abyll's haloforge project.
Tempera is also: Between major refactorings and feature updates.
Tempera is in need of: feedback and help. No need for halo-specific modding experience. 

Tempera is not: Stable. While it _shouldn't_ cause any issues, it comes with no warranty, express or implied.
Tempera is not: Good for your health. The codebase contains an unnecessary number of swears, badly-organized file and general structure. 
Tempera uses: CrasRpt1401.lib, capstone_static.lib, and detours.lib in order to provide a number of its features. 

Tempera aims to: Add the Local Splitscreen multiplayer which was removed from Halo PC and Halo Custom Edition.
Tempera aims to: Add a Forge-like mode for Halo Custom Edition.

At one point, I was using Chimera as a base for Tempera. All of ChaosVex's code has been removed, and Tempera is now completely separate. 

While I have attempted to ensure most files are credited to their specific creators, attribution is still inconsistent. 

While Kornman's structures are used as the basis for ~95% of the code, I often fail to credit them. For the origin source code to 
Open Sauce, please see: https://bitbucket.org/KornnerStudios/opensauce-release/wiki/Home.

SilentK and Abyll's haloforge project was, as far as I remember, kept in private. Initially intended as a mod for halo PC, v1.08
in 2008-2009, I received access to the source, and was able to update it to 1.10 while at the same time, fixing some bugs with forge.
Out of respect for SilentK and Abyll's efforts, I have not released the code until now. 

Tempera's repository may be the only publicly released code from their original live_projekt. 

Theoretically, Tempera should compile with MinGW thanks to CMake. In either case, the Windows 10 SDK and a separate DirectX sdk is required. Any DirectX sdk from 2007 to 2010 should be compatible.
