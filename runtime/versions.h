/**
 * I'm going to go on a bit of a lecture here everyone who reads this code
 * can potentially understand what I'm trying to do here.
 *
 * Tempera is a different project structure for large and expansive modding
 * of the blam engine. Inherited and a bit of a mishmash between two old
 * projects where one never really got off the ground (haloforge) and the
 * other only sees modest use from SPv3 and CMT, my goal for the library
 * is to create a truly extensible (and readable) system for creating and
 * managing large mods of a game engine.
 *
 * Open Sauce's primary failing was that it was so large and complex,
 * it's practically unusable. Additionally, while I have mad respect for
 * the creator's work, not only is Open Sauce not nearly as widely used as
 * it should be for the massive amount of power it gives the developer,
 * Open Sauce is frozen in time. Kornman00 has gone on to work for 343i.
 *
 * I believe is safe to assume that Kornman00 will not be providing updates
 * to Open Sauce.
 *
 * --------------------
 *
 * With that preface, let's dive into the idea behind the managing systems.
 *
 * IEngine - The Generic interface for utilizing features provided within
 * Tempera. Every implementation of the engine which is added should be
 * a descendant of this interface.
 *
