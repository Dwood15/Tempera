I, Dason Woodhouse (Dwood15), do not endorse piracy, and believe that to every extent possible, users should be using the latest versions of this software, which they have paid for.
 
Unfortunately, over the past years, each of these runtimes, save halo trial, have been updated and patched to differing degrees, leaving mods for these game engine in the dust.
 
This is why these version files and folders exist. 

For choosing a game target, as of May 10, 2018, only 1.10 of halo custom edition is supported. I look forward to finding out how to add full support for the Halo Editing Kit in the future. 

Halo Trial, HEK, Stubbz the Zombie, nor Dedicated Server support are planned for at this time. The folders are there for any adventurous individuals to take up the efforts as they desire.

I may add support for different versions of custom edition or minor support for various PC, however. :)
